        <h3>The EAS Special Session on Welfare and Mental Health in Astronomy Research</h3>
        <h1>Anonymous Letters</h1>

        <p>Welcome to our digital wall of anonymous letters. These are letters that have been submitted by participants of the 2021
        European Astronomical Society Annual Meeting as part of the special session on welfare and mental health in astronomy
        (SS8). They detail the lived experiences of those in astronomical research. The submissions have been screened by the
        session SOC to ensure they are not discriminatory and are anonymous. Below there are a number of tags that you can select/deselect
        if you wish to filter specific topics. Letter submission will remain open throughout the EAS. You can <a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KPgc_1jcxHWZW3iyoJA2PXNufHVJtnwjzMtCQwu2FI0/edit'>submit a letter here</a>.

                <h3>Learning How Low My Self-confidence Could Go</h3>
                <div class="content">
                My PhD supervisor was sexist, mean and racist. He is a bully and loved to put me down to make himself feel intelligent and powerful. He told me I am not in the top 10% of students so I should go into industry and save myself the struggle. He suggested high-class prostitution as a valid option. Just before my PhD thesis defense he told me to tell them I am dyslexic and that is the reason my writing is very poor (even though three of my papers had been published in a peer-reviewed journal), I told him I did not have this, but he said to lie because my writing was that shit. This made me so nervous I tripped over my feet when going into my defense room. During meetings he would often fall asleep, I would have to leave the office
                <span class="readmore"></span>
                <span class="more hidden"> embarrassed and try to set up another meeting. When I asked him questions he told me to go away and not ask him questions. During meetings he would tell me everything I had done wrong but without guidance on how to fix it, again when asked he said that was my job. He would mark my papers and when I changed things, next time he would often change it back-infuriating, and when I asked him once he ignored me. When I first started my PhD he showed me to a room, gave me a book on Astrophysics, left me the whole day, and said to read the book and come find him when I finished. A close family member died during my second year, and when I heard the news I went to him to tell him I had to go home (obviously upset and crying) and be with my family, and he offered no condolences but just asked when I would be coming back. When travelling with him he would be racist to other people, in often a loud voice-while I tried to hide. He did not turn up at my PhD graduation, he did not even give an excuse. I felt no support or help from him, except to lower my self-confidence. He never helped me and I learnt very quickly that if  I wanted this PhD I would have to do it myself and ask help from my fellow PhDs and postdocs. When I asked him about his previous PhD student he said she sold herself to finance, which meant it was hard to ever talk to him about careers. I have never told anyone about how bad he was, because if I wanted to continue my career in academia he has the power to destroy it. My mental health suffered under him, I barely made it through, there were many times when I wanted to end everything (and not just my PhD). I suffered from severe panic attacks, once I had to go to the doctors because I thought it was a heart attack. I cracked my back teeth because of grinding my teeth due to all of the stress and still have to sleep with a mouth guard, many many years later. I am still not over this probably because I have blocked most things-so the list above is the tip of the iceberg. When I got my postdoc he did not congratulate me and tell me well done. During my postdoc my new supervisor could see how much I suffered and sent me to therapy. My self-confidence and my mental health will take more time to heal. I never felt good enough for my PhD and doubted myself every day, this feeling still exists in me and most of these feelings about my ability (or lack of) is due to his treatment. Basically I felt stupid everyday and I wondered every day why he chose me, I did ask him and he said he got given one this year due to funding but never chose me. I felt stupid and not chosen with no support or help from my supervisor for the majority of my PhD. My PhD was one of the worst times of my life and the majority of this was because of my supervisor. If I could go back in time I would never have done this PhD. Now I just have to accept what happened and try to continue my life and build my confidence and mental health.

                <h3>When Understanding Runs Out</h3>
                <div class="content">
                  I did observational astronomy research as an undergraduate, fully intending to pursue graduate school and a career in the field. However, after the first semester of working with my PI, several traumatic things happened in my personal life, including the simultaneous loss of my health insurance, which meant that my access to therapy was cut in half so that I could still afford it. My PI was at first extremely understanding, and did not push me when it came to my research. However, the following summer she decided that because I still wasn't productive enough, she would take a micromanaging approach to ensure my productivity, requiring that I send an email with what I was doing every single day.
                    <span class="readmore"></span>
                    <span class="more hidden"> This proved to be even worse for both my mental health and our relationship. I had crippling depression that kept me from getting out of bed most days, and barely scraped by that summer with the threat that I'd lose my financial support if I didn't produce enough results. <br><br> <p> The following fall semester (first semester of my senior year), we came to an understanding that the micromanaging strategy was not good for me, and so my PI ended up taking the opposite approach of providing almost no support. I continued to struggle in both research and classes. During the last month of the semester, my PI came to me and told me that I had simply not done enough work to deserve the research credit I was enrolled in. She agreed to give me an incomplete on the condition that I work twice as hard the next semester. Trying to save my degree and my chances at getting into graduate school, I agreed. </p>
                      <br>

                      <p> Long story short, after some advocacy from my program advisor and multiple sessions of crying in my PI's office, I got her to agree to let me extend my work into the summer after graduation so that I could get full credit. The experience ended with me being forced to do the last few days of work while driving cross-country to graduate school because she refused to continue communication with me after a certain date. Because of how terrible the experience was, I ultimately decided not to pursue graduate school in observational astronomy. Sometimes I wonder if that would have been the case if things had been different with my undergraduate PI. Thankfully, my advisor in graduate school has been so supportive and understanding when I need an extra push to keep going. Just knowing that I have his support and understanding makes it so much easier to get myself back into the headspace of wanting to work. </p>
